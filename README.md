### Motivation
Building and deploying interactive web-based application is the culmination of my [NYC_crimes_2018](https://github.com/mihalw28/NYC_crimes_2018) project. 

### General info
Application from this repo is based on [Dash - Uber Data App](https://dash-uber-rides.plot.ly/) :oncoming_taxi: source code. Main concepts are similar. This app is based on data created using code from [NYC_crimes_2018](https://github.com/mihalw28/NYC_crimes_2018).

### Built with
* [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) :panda_face:
* [numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) :1234:
* [plotly](https://plot.ly/)
* [mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) :world_map:
* [dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash)

If you are new in dash like me :beginner:, please visit this [site](https://github.com/plotly/dash-docs), to get you in. You can read there about how to runn app locally. :dash: 

### App content explanations
* Dataset used to make this app contains about 100k incidents just from january to march 2018. Dividing them into categories could cause plotting only few points on map and nothing on bar chart.
* Dividing incidents into more categories are useless due to limited number of data points. 
* Historical data contains about 6 millions rows and will be implemented in this app in future. Available [@NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i).
